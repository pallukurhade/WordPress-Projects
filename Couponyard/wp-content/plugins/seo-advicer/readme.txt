= How to Implement SEO Actions suggested by SEO Advicer =
As mentioned earlier, SEO Advicer will not do or implement any SEO Action suggested by itself. You need to do those SEO tweaks yourself. Most of the SEO Actions are very simple to implement, because SEO Advicer tells you how and where. However, there are some SEO tweaks that you can't do alone.

It's where you need to get the help of Professional SEO Provider. If you have someone who's got your favor, We suggest you to implement those SEO Actions. You can also hire ScorpionGod Lair to optimize your WordPress Website by using our OnSite SEO Service.

= Higher Search Rankings =
You never earn anything as long as you don't <b>Take Action</b>. And you'll never get to the Higher Search Engine Rankings, If you don't Take Action on what is suggested by the SEO Advicer plugin. First take action on Simple SEO Tasks by yourself and get the help of SEO Service Provider to do the advanced ones.

More importantly, If you don't create <b>Unique</b> and <b>Useful Content</b> you'll miss the chance of getting targeted Organic Traffic to your website from Search Engines.

= Another Ranking Fact =
Loading Time and Website Performance is something you should start concentrating more than before. If you're using a Genesis Teme and using Social Share Counters, then you do need to use [Genesis Optimized Social Share](http://wordpress.org/plugins/genesis-optimized-social-share/) Plugin today to load your Social Scripts without affecting to your Loading Time and Google PageSpeed Score.
